  Here, we present a spatially adaptive active-learning framework with closed-loop experimentation for targeted catalyst optimization. Bayesian optimization and a conditional variational autoencoder first identify a low-overpotential stability subspace, followed by active learning to pinpoint the most stable candidate. This strategy leads to the discovery of a Cu–RuO₂ catalyst with outstanding durability (625 h) and a low overpotential of 177 mV at 10 mA cm⁻². Our results highlight an efficient AI-driven pathway for accelerating the design of stable acidic OER catalysts.
