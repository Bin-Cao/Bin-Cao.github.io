abstract: >-
  Efficient exploration of vast compositional and processing spaces is essential for accelerated materials discovery. Bayesian optimization (BO) provides a principled strategy for identifying optimal materials with minimal experiments, yet its adoption in materials science is hindered by implementation complexity and limited domain-specific tools. Here, we present Bgolearn, a comprehensive Python framework that makes BO accessible and practical for materials research through an intuitive interface, robust algorithms, and materials-oriented workflows.
