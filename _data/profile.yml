      I am a PhD student at
      <a href="https://www.hkust-gz.edu.cn/" style="color: #66bb6a;">HKUST (Guangzhou)</a>,
      working with
      <a href="https://english.casad.cas.cn/members/casm/dots/202404/t20240418_660476.html" style="color: #66bb6a;">Prof. ZHANG Tong-Yi</a>.
      My research focuses on <strong>artificial intelligence for materials science</strong>, with particular emphasis on algorithm development for <strong>crystallography and spectroscopy</strong>.
      During my PhD, I also served as a visiting student at
      <a href="https://www.cityu.edu.hk/" style="color: #66bb6a;">City University of Hong Kong</a>,
      working with
      <a href="https://scholars.cityu.edu.hk/en/persons/yangren/" style="color: #66bb6a;">Prof. REN Yang</a>,
      and an intern at
      <a href="https://www.shlab.org.cn/" style="color: #66bb6a;">Shanghai AI Lab</a>
      (AI4S Department).
      </p>

      <p>
      Before joining HKUST (Guangzhou), I earned an <strong>MPhil in Mechanics</strong> at
      <a href="https://www.shu.edu.cn/" style="color: #66bb6a;">Shanghai University</a>,
      working with
      <a href="https://english.casad.cas.cn/members/casm/dots/202404/t20240418_660476.html" style="color: #66bb6a;">Prof. ZHANG Tong-Yi</a>.
      During this period, I also interned at
      <a href="https://www.zhejianglab.org/" style="color: #66bb6a;">Zhejiang Laboratory</a>,
      where I worked on <strong>transfer learning for materials science</strong>.
      I received my <strong>BEng in Chemical Machinery</strong> from
      <a href="https://www.buct.edu.cn/main.htm" style="color: #66bb6a;">Beijing University of Chemical Technology</a>,
      where my work focused on <strong>finite element and chemistry</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
      In recent years, I developed a series of machine-learning algorithms for
      <strong>crystal structure determination</strong>
      (<a href="https://github.com/Bin-Cao/XQueryer" style="color: #66bb6a;">XQueryer</a>),
      <strong>crystal property prediction</strong> (PRDNet), and
      <strong>novel crystal discovery</strong>
      (<a href="https://github.com/Bin-Cao/SimXRD" style="color: #66bb6a;">SimXRD</a>).
      My first-author papers have appeared in materials science journals (e.g., <em>National Science Review</em> and <em>Science Bulletin</em>) and AI conferences such as ICLR.
      </p>

      <p>
      One of my long-term projects, <strong>Bgolearn</strong>, received support from the
      <em>Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Open Source Award Project Support Plan</em>,
      where I serve as the
      <a href="https://github.com/Bin-Cao/Bgolearn/blob/main/figures/funding.png" style="color: #66bb6a;">principal developer</a>.
      The project was awarded <strong>RMB 500,000</strong> to support the development of the open-source
      <a href="https://github.com/Bin-Cao/Bgolearn" style="color: #66bb6a;">Bgolearn</a> platform.
      Outside of research, I enjoy <strong>jogging</strong> and <strong>watching movies</strong>.
