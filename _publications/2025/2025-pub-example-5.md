abstract: >-
  This work developed an integrated AL software, BgoFace, which satisfies most material property optimization re-quirements. The application of BgoFace (with default setting) successfully accel-erated the discovery of G4-based CPL materials, achievingresults within six iterations and synthesizing 24 experimentalgroups. The final QY nearly doubled the initial best QY inthe training dataset.
