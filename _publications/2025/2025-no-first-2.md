   With the Open Experimental Powder X-ray Diffraction Database (opXRD), we providean openly available and easily accessible dataset of labeled and unlabeled experimental powder diffractograms. Labeled opXRDdata can be used to evaluate the performance of models on experimental data and unlabeled opXRD data can help improve theperformance of models on experimental data, for example, through transfer learning methods. We collected 92,552 diffractograms,2179 of them labeled, from a wide spectrum of material classes. We hope this ongoing effort can guide machine learning researchtoward fully automated analysis of pXRD data and thus enable future self-driving materials labs.
