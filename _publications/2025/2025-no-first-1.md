   Herein, a multifunctional surface engineering is successfully applied to improve Li1.2Mn0.54Co0.13Ni0.13O2 materials by a facile method of solution pretreatment followed by high-temperature thermal treatment. Gradient fluorine doping on the near-surface region is demonstrated to induce the higher ratio of Mn3+/Mn4+, the increasing amounts of oxygen vacancies and the decreasing Li+ diffusion energy barrier.
