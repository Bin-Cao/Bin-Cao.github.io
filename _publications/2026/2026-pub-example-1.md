  We propose PRDNet, a novel architecture that integrates graph embeddings with a learned pseudoparticle diffraction module. It generates synthetic diffraction patterns that are invariant to crystallographic symmetries. We extensively evaluate PRDNet on multiple large-scale benchmarks, including Materials Project, JARVIS-DFT, and MatBench. Our model achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of crystal property prediction tasks, demonstrating its effectiveness.
