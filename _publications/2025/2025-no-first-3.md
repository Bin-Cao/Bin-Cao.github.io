  This work takes NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 (NFM) as a model cathode and dissects the chemical strain in inactive components by combining operando XRD and digital image correlation techniques to simultaneously measure the chemically induced phase transformation strain and overall strain. Results reveal considerable negative strain during initial charge and positive strain after discharge, and the positive residual strain accumulates over cycles.
