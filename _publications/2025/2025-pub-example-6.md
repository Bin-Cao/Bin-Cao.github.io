  We developed XQueryer, an intelligent agent for simulating, recognizing, and analyzing powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) patterns. Trained on over two million high-fidelity simulated spectra, XQueryer achieves significantly higher accuracy—28.9% better than existing AI models and traditional methods. Integrated with a powder diffractometer, it enables real-time structural analysis of crystal samples.
