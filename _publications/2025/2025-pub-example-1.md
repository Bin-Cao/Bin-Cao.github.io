  We developed a novel XRD simulation method that incorporates comprehensive physical interactions, resulting in a high-fidelity database. SimXRD comprises 4,065,346 simulated powder XRD patterns, representing 119,569 unique crystal structures under 33 simulated conditions that reflect real-world variations. We benchmark 21 sequence models in both in-library and out-of-library scenarios and analyze the impact of class imbalance in longtailed crystal label distributions. Remarkably, we find that: (1) current neural networks struggle with classifying low-frequency crystals, particularly in out-oflibrary situations; (2) models trained on SimXRD can generalize to real experimental data.
