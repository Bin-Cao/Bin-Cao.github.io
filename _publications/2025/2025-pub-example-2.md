abstract: >-
  We apply an interpretable AL strategy to efficiently optimize the photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) of carbon dots (CDs) in photothermal therapy (PTT). Using this approach, we successfully synthesized irondoped CDs (Fe-CDs) with PCE exceeding 78.7% after only 16 experimental trials over four iterations.
