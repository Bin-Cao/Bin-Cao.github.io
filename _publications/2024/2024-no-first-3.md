   we employed a simple citric acid treatment (CA-treatment) method to fabricate the Li-rich spinel coating layer on LRMs. This in situ formed spinel Li4Mn5O12 layer successfully suppresses the oxygen release, provides three-dimensional (3D) lithium-ion diffusion channels and enriches Li embedding sites, resulting in a substantial improvement in the rate capability and high-rate cycling performance.
